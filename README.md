# Drag-and-Drop-puzzle
This puzzle game takes place on a 5x5 board. Try to use the pieces on the bottom of the page to complete the picture in the fewest moves possible.

Note: You can swap pieces by dragging one and dropping it over another piece. However, this will count as a move, even though you swap 2 pieces within the starting picture bank.
Good luck and have fun!


Shoutout to ImKennyYip for creating the original version of this game. I'm using this to get experience developing webapps with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
